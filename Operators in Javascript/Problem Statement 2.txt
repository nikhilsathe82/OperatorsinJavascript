Problem Statement 2
JavaScript uses a comma (,) to represent the comma operator.
A comma operator takes two expressions, evaluates them from left to right, and returns the value of the right expression.

for example:
let x = 20
let y = (x++, x+2)

console.log(y); //23

explanation:
In this example, we increase the value of x by one (x++), add 2 to x (x+2) and assign x to y. Therefore, x is 22, and y is 23 after the statement.
